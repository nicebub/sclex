/**
	This file includes the function expror() wich is the part of the parser that
recognizes a list of expressions, and construct a parse tree to represent the input
stream that it read as the so-called list. This parse tree is then returned with a
pointer to the structure. The list is one expression optionally seperated by a
'|' token, OR. Only one of these epxressions will later on be recognized on the
input stream during lexing.
	This function will call other parts of the parser to recognize and parse more
of the input stream.
