/**

This file is an example 'Wrapper' function that acts as a main
executable and calls the lexer generated from previous example

The program will assume the first argument is a file name to a file that
exists or it will generate an error and finish. Otherwise the file is opened,
buffered, and sent to the lexer to see if what is written in the file is recognized
as part of the language described from the regular expressions that the lexer
represents.
